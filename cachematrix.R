## This script contain two functions that creates a special matrix with the makeCacheMatrix function 
## then cacheSolve inverse the matrix. The interesting thing is that this functions saves the answers
## in the cache, in case the same matrix is asked later.

## This function creates the special matrix, which is a list, that saves in the cache the inverse matrix.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function solves the special matrix from the makeCacheMatrix function, and checks if the answer is in the 
## cache, if so, it retrieves a message and the solution.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
